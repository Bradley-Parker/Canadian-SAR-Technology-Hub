# SAR Hub Resource Authoring Skill

This skill teaches agents and contributors how to take raw field knowledge, templates, SOPs, or vendor-neutral tools and publish them as clean, accessible, practitioner-focused resources for the **Canadian SAR Technology Hub**.

---

## 1. The Persona & The "Ground Searcher" Tone

All content on this hub must be written for the **Operational Practitioner**:
- **Target Reader**: Anyone from an 18-year-old student recruit to a 55-year-old retired teacher or tradesperson volunteering as Search Manager.
- **Tone**: Warm, clear, direct, and practical—like a well-written Canadian community newspaper or a Parks Canada field guide.
- **Reading Level**: Target **Grade 6–8**. Keep sentences short, active, and conversational.
- **The 02:00 Test**: If an exhausted search manager arriving at an Incident Command Post (ICP) at 2:00 AM cannot understand the instruction in 30 seconds, rewrite it.

### Words to Avoid vs. Words to Use

| ❌ Banned Corporate / Tech Jargon | ✅ Plain Field Replacement |
| :--- | :--- |
| "highest-leverage operational improvements" | "one of the easiest ways to keep your team organized" |
| "provisioning" / "deprovisioning" | "setting up", "creating", "removing" |
| "leverage" | "use", "rely on" |
| "interoperability" | "working smoothly together", "sharing data" |
| "tracking modality" | "GPS type", "tracking method" (phone, inReach, GPS) |
| "force multiplier" | "helpful tool", "huge time saver" |
| "streamline workflows" | "keep things simple", "save time" |
| "holistic paradigm" | "complete picture", "practical approach" |
| "situational awareness" *(overused)* | "so everyone sees the same picture" |

## 2. Standard Resource Page Anatomy

When authoring a resource under `docs/resources/<category>/<slug>.md`, follow this exact structural flow:

```markdown
---
title: "Clear, Actionable Title"
description: "A 1-2 sentence plain-English summary of what this tool does and who it helps."
category: "Mapping & GIS" # Options: Mapping & GIS, Communications, Search Management, Field Hardware, Training & Standards, Medical & Evacuation
jurisdiction:
  - "National" # Options: National, BC, AB, SK, MB, ON, QC, NB, NS, PE, NL, YT, NT, NU
tags:
  - "mapping"          # Dimension 1 [Category Tag]: mapping, search-management, communications, etc.
  - "avenza"           # Dimension 2 [Tool]: caltopo, avenza, d4h, etc.
  - "ground-searcher"  # Dimension 3 [Role]: ground-searcher, search-manager, team-leader, etc. (optional)
  - "overview"         # Dimension 4 [Type]: template, guide, review, overview
  # - "free"           # Dimension 5 [Special Descriptor]: only when truly relevant (e.g., free, open-source)
maintainer: "Team Name or Contributor"
date_updated: YYYY-MM-DD

# Clear, Actionable Title

[1-2 paragraphs introducing what problem this solves in the field. Open with the real-world headache it prevents, why it matters, and who champion/tested it.]

---

## Download Operational Templates (If Applicable)

[Use Material cards for prominent download buttons. When offering templates, provide a Clean version ready for calls and a Guided version with help markers.]

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-folder-check:{ .lg .middle } **Clean Template (Ready for a Call)**

    ---

    Contains empty folders and structure ready for live mission tasking.

    [:material-download: Download Clean Template (.geojson)](../../assets/files/geo/filename-clean.geojson){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

-   :material-help-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Guided Template (With Notes & Markers)**

    ---

    Contains the same structure plus instructional markers explaining what goes where.

    [:material-download: Download Guided Template (.geojson)](../../assets/files/geo/filename-guided.geojson){ .md-button }

</div>

## How to Use This Resource

[Break procedures into sequential H3 headings (e.g., ### Method 1, ### Method 2). DO NOT use horizontal tabs (`=== "..."`) because long tab titles wrap or truncate on mobile screens and hide critical steps.]

### Method 1: [Recommended Workflow]

1. Numbered, step-by-step instructions.
2. Bold action verbs first.
3. Include external reference links where helpful.

---

### Method 2: [Alternative or Offline Workflow]

1. Step one.
2. Step two.

---

## Standard Reference Table / Data Dictionary

[When defining folders, radio channels, or equipment kits, use a clear Markdown table:]

| Category | Item Name | What Goes in Here | Helpful Tips & Field Rules |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section** | `Item 1` | • Clear bullet points | Plain explanation of field rules |

---

## Practical Tips for the Field

[3-5 bulleted operational gotchas: cold weather limitations, preserving audit trails, shifting operational periods, offline caching before leaving cell coverage.]

---

## Thanks & Credits

[Acknowledge the volunteers, teams, and associations (e.g., BCSARA, OSARVA, SARVAC) who developed, tested, and shared the resource.]
```

## 3. Tagging Discipline: The 4+1 Dimension Framework

We do **not** invent tags on the fly or create tags "just for fun." Too many arbitrary tags make tag navigation noisy and unhelpful.

Aim for **up to 4 tags** per resource (one per core dimension), with an optional 5th tag only when there is a strong operational reason (such as highlighting that a solution is `free` or `open-source`). Avoid going higher than 4 tags without a clear reason.

### The Core Dimensions

| Dimension | Question It Answers | Allowed Values / Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Category** | *What high-level operational domain is this? (Helps find it via the tags menu)* | `mapping`, `communications`, `search-management`, `field-hardware`, `training-standards`, `medical-evacuation`, `team-admin` |
| **2. Tool** | *What specific software, app, or hardware is featured?* | `caltopo`, `avenza`, `qgis`, `d4h`, `sar-command-assist`, `inreach`, `garmin`, `zoleo`, `rpas`, `flir` |
| **3. Role** | *Who uses this or who is the primary operational audience?* | `search-manager`, `ground-searcher`, `team-leader`, `incident-commander`, `equipment-officer`, `team-admin` |
| **4. Type ("What is it?")** | *What kind of resource is this document?* | **`template`** (downloadable operational template/config)<br>**`guide`** (practical procedural how-to / SOP)<br>**`review`** (field-tested assessment of gear or software)<br>**`overview`** (high-level introduction to a platform) |
| **5. Special Descriptor** *(Optional)* | *Is there a critical field or licensing attribute users filter by?* | `free`, `open-source`, `offline-first`, `privacy` |

### Tagging Rules
1. **Target 3 to 4 Tags**: Stick to the primary dimensions (e.g. `["mapping", "avenza", "overview"]` or `["mapping", "caltopo", "search-manager", "template"]`). Only add a 5th tag if there is a distinct benefit.
2. **One Tag Per Dimension**: Pick at most one tag per dimension so tags remain balanced and searchable.
3. **No Fluff or Arbitrary Tags**: Avoid vague junk tags like `handouts`, `tips`, `cool`, `team-assignments`, or `forms`.
4. **Controlled Vocabulary**: Always draw tags from `docs/contributing/taxonomy.md` so in-browser search and tag filtering remain clean.

---

## 4. Asset Management Rules

1. **Keep Assets Independent**:
   Always save downloadable files (.geojson, .gpx, .kml, .docx, .xlsx, .pdf) in `docs/assets/files/`:
   - `docs/assets/files/geo/` for spatial layers and map templates.
   - `docs/assets/files/forms/` for briefing sheets, ICS forms, and debrief templates.
   - `docs/assets/files/configs/` for radio profiles, app config files, and device backups.
2. **Never Embed Binary Blobs Directly**: Keep the file standalone so teams can download, update, or link to the asset file independently of the article.
3. **Format Clean JSON/GeoJSON**: Use 2-space indentation so version diffs are human-readable in git.

## 5. The 5-Step Publishing Checklist

Every time a new resource is added to the hub, execute all 5 steps:

- [ ] **Step 1: Save the asset files** into `docs/assets/files/<subfolder>/` using lowercase hyphenated names.
- [ ] **Step 2: Create the resource page** under `docs/resources/<category>/<resource-slug>.md` using standard frontmatter, strict tagging rules (1–3 tags, no junk/category duplicates), and plain-language anatomy.
- [ ] **Step 3: Update the Category Directory Index** in `docs/resources/<category>/index.md` by adding a card linking to the new page.
- [ ] **Step 4: Update Site Navigation** in `mkdocs.yml` under `nav > Resources > <Category>`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Log in the Changelog** in `docs/whats-new.md` under the current month with a concise summary and link.
